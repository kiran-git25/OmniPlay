📌
Build an open-source, cross-platform application called **OmniPlay**.

🔧 PURPOSE:
OmniPlay lets users **open, view, read, play, and share** all common file types — including documents, media files, archives — with a simple interface, **total local privacy**, and **no server-side storage**.

📁 SUPPORTED FORMATS:
- Documents: `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.txt`, `.csv`, `.xlsx`, `.pptx`, `.odt`, `.epub`
- Archives: `.zip`, `.rar`, `.7z` (read-only)
- Media:
  - Audio: `.mp3`, `.wav`, `.ogg`, `.aac`, `.flac`, `.m4a`
  - Video: `.mp4`, `.webm`, `.avi`, `.mov`, `.mkv`, `.flv`
- Links:
  - Safe streaming of direct media URLs (e.g. `.mp3`, `.mp4`)
  - Safe YouTube and other streaming links (ad-free if legally permitted)
  - Links from `.txt` or `.json` files
- Unsafe executables: `.exe`, `.js`, `.bat`, etc. → **viewable only as plain text with warnings**

💻 PLATFORM SUPPORT:
- Web (desktop/mobile)
- Desktop (via Capacitor/electron)
- Android & iOS (via Capacitor)
- Fully responsive, cross-browser UI

📱 UI/UX REQUIREMENTS:
- Simple, clean layout
- Drag & drop or file picker to open files
- Tabbed/minimized multi-window viewer for multitasking
- Dark/light mode optional
- Must support playing media while app is in background (like a music app)

🔗 EXTERNAL FEATURES:
- Search bar to input YouTube/media URLs (play in player safely)
- Can extract and play links from local text files
- OpenMediaUrl component with format detection and warnings

🌐 NETWORK OPTIONS:
1. **Offline mode (LAN/Bluetooth/Wi-Fi Direct)**:
   - Share files and chat peer-to-peer
   - No internet or server dependency
   - No cloud relay

2. **Online mode** (optional):
   - Secure voice and video calls (e.g., via WebRTC)
   - Private group chats
   - File/media sharing
   - Option to delete chat history and groups manually
   - No accounts, no analytics

🔐 PRIVACY & SECURITY:
- **100% client-side only** — no data ever sent or stored externally
- Dangerous file types are sandboxed and never executed
- Local warning component (`UnsafeFileWarning.jsx`) alerts users before opening risky files
- `dangerousExtensions.js` defines unsafe extensions
- `OpenMediaUrl.jsx` allows safe media URL access

🛡️ LEGAL + ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS:
- MIT License (with LICENSE.md)
- TERMS.md: clear user responsibilities
- PRIVACY.md: no data collection, no tracking, no analytics
- SECURITY.md: technical safety measures
- DISCLAIMER.md: “use at your own risk”
- ETHICAL_USE.md: prohibits illegal or malicious use
- APP NOTICE:
  > OmniPlay is intended for legal personal use only. The authors are not liable for any misuse of this app.

🧠 ETHICAL SAFEGUARDS:
- No Tor or anonymous wide-broadcast support
- Peer sharing requires manual device pairing (QR/Bluetooth/NFC)
- User must manually accept shared files
- Optional “Report Misuse” tool: users can locally save reports of abuse attempts
- No user accounts, no PII stored anywhere

🧪 TESTS & MAINTENANCE:
- Include automated virus-simulation test with mock malicious extensions
- Option to run app security check via unit tests (fake files)
- Update README.md with features, usage, license, and security statement
- Use Vercel (React preset) for deployment
