# Privacy Policy

## Overview

OmniPlay is designed with privacy as a fundamental principle. This privacy policy explains our commitment to protecting your data and privacy.

## Core Privacy Principles

### Zero Data Collection
- **No user accounts:** OmniPlay requires no registration or personal information
- **No analytics:** We do not track usage patterns, file types, or user behavior
- **No telemetry:** No diagnostic or performance data is collected
- **No cookies:** The application does not set tracking cookies

### Local Processing Only
- **Client-side operation:** All file processing occurs on your device
- **No file uploads:** Your files never leave your device unless you explicitly share them
- **No server storage:** We do not store, cache, or process files on our servers
- **Memory-only processing:** File data exists only in your browser's memory during use

## Data Handling Practices

### What We Don't Collect
- Personal identifying information (PII)
- File contents or metadata
- IP addresses or device identifiers
- Usage statistics or analytics
- Error reports or crash data
- Location information

### Local Browser Storage
- **Disabled storage:** localStorage and sessionStorage are programmatically disabled
- **No caching:** Files are not cached in browser storage
- **Automatic cleanup:** Memory is automatically cleared during and after use
- **Session isolation:** Each browser session is independent with no persistent data

### Third-Party Interactions
- **Remote URLs:** When you load content from URLs, you interact directly with those servers
- **CDN libraries:** Some JavaScript libraries may be loaded from CDNs for functionality
- **No data sharing:** We do not share any information with third parties

## Security Measures

### Technical Safeguards
- **Content Security Policy:** Strict CSP headers prevent unauthorized scripts
- **No-cache headers:** Prevent browser or proxy caching of sensitive content
- **Sandboxed processing:** Dangerous files are processed in isolated environments
- **Memory protection:** Automatic cleanup prevents data persistence

### Privacy by Design
- **Minimal permissions:** The application requests no special permissions
- **Open source:** Full transparency through open-source code
- **Local execution:** No network dependencies for core functionality
- **User control:** You control all data sharing and external connections

## User Rights and Control

### Your Control
- **Data ownership:** You retain full ownership of all files and data
- **Processing control:** You choose what files to process and when
- **Sharing control:** Any data sharing requires your explicit action
- **Deletion control:** Close your browser to remove all processing artifacts

### Privacy Settings
- **No configuration needed:** Privacy protection is automatic and cannot be disabled
- **Browser controls:** Use browser settings for additional privacy controls
- **Clear data:** Use browser's "Clear browsing data" for complete cleanup

## Compliance and Standards

### Regulatory Compliance
- **GDPR Article 25:** Privacy by design and default
- **CCPA compliance:** No personal data collection or sale
- **PIPEDA compliance:** No personal information processing or storage

### Industry Standards
- **Zero trust model:** No implicit trust in data handling
- **Principle of least privilege:** Minimal data access and retention
- **Defense in depth:** Multiple layers of privacy protection

## External Services and URLs

### When You Use URLs
- You connect directly to external servers
- Those services have their own privacy policies
- We cannot control external privacy practices
- Review privacy policies of services you access

### CDN and Libraries
- JavaScript libraries may be loaded from content delivery networks
- These connections are for functionality only
- No user data is transmitted to CDN providers

## Data Retention

### No Data Retention
- **Zero retention policy:** No data is retained after browser closure
- **Automatic deletion:** All processing artifacts are automatically removed
- **No backups:** We maintain no backups or copies of user data
- **Session boundaries:** Data exists only during active browser sessions

## Updates and Changes

### Policy Updates
- Privacy policy changes will be published in this document
- Continued use implies acceptance of updated policies
- Privacy protections will never be weakened without clear notice

### Transparency
- All changes are documented in the project repository
- Community review of privacy-related changes
- Open source nature ensures transparency

## Contact and Enforcement

### Questions
- Review project documentation for technical privacy details
- Examine source code for implementation verification
- Participate in community discussions about privacy

### Enforcement
- Privacy violations should be reported to relevant authorities
- Use built-in reporting tools for documenting misuse
- Community oversight helps maintain privacy standards

## Verification

### How to Verify
- **Network monitoring:** Use browser developer tools to verify no data transmission
- **Source code review:** Examine the open-source code for privacy implementation
- **Browser storage:** Check that no data persists in browser storage
- **Memory usage:** Verify automatic cleanup through browser task manager
