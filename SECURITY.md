# Security Policy

## Security Architecture

OmniPlay implements multiple layers of security to protect users from potential threats while maintaining privacy and functionality.

## Core Security Principles

### Defense in Depth
- **Client-side processing:** No server-side vulnerabilities
- **Sandboxed execution:** Isolated processing environments
- **Input validation:** Comprehensive file type and content validation
- **Memory protection:** Automatic cleanup prevents data leaks

### Zero Trust Model
- **No implicit trust:** All files treated as potentially dangerous
- **Explicit warnings:** Users must acknowledge risks for dangerous file types
- **Minimal privileges:** Application requests no special system permissions

## File Security Measures

### Dangerous File Detection
- **Comprehensive blacklist:** 50+ dangerous file extensions identified
- **Category-based warnings:** Different security levels for different file types
- **User consent required:** Explicit user approval for processing dangerous files
- **Text-only viewing:** Dangerous files displayed as text only

### Safe Processing
- **No execution:** Files are never executed, only viewed
- **FileReader API:** Safe browser-native file reading
- **Content Security Policy:** Prevents unauthorized script execution
- **Blob URL management:** Automatic cleanup of temporary URLs

## Network Security

### HTTPS Enforcement
- **Secure connections:** All external requests use HTTPS when possible
- **Certificate validation:** Rely on browser certificate validation
- **CORS compliance:** Respect cross-origin resource sharing policies

### No Server Dependencies
- **Local processing:** No data transmitted to processing servers
- **Direct connections:** URL loading connects directly to source servers
- **No relay services:** No intermediate servers handle user data

## Browser Security Integration

### Content Security Policy
```
default-src 'self'; 
script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; 
style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; 
img-src 'self' data: blob:; 
media-src 'self' blob:; 
object-src 'none';
```

### Security Headers
- **X-Frame-Options:** Prevents clickjacking attacks
- **X-Content-Type-Options:** Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **Referrer-Policy:** Controls referrer information leakage
- **Cache-Control:** Prevents caching of sensitive content

## Memory Security

### Automatic Cleanup
- **Object URL revocation:** Immediate cleanup of blob URLs
- **Memory management:** Periodic cleanup of file data
- **Session isolation:** No data persistence between sessions
- **Garbage collection:** Encourages browser memory cleanup

### Data Isolation
- **Temporary storage only:** Data exists only in active memory
- **No persistent storage:** Disabled localStorage and sessionStorage
- **Process isolation:** Browser sandbox provides process-level isolation

## Input Validation and Sanitization

### File Validation
- **MIME type checking:** Verify file types match extensions
- **Size limitations:** Configurable file size limits
- **Extension validation:** Whitelist and blacklist extension checking
- **Content scanning:** Basic content validation for text files

### URL Validation
- **Protocol checking:** Only HTTP/HTTPS protocols allowed
- **Format validation:** URL structure and format validation
- **Domain restrictions:** No access to local network addresses
- **Extension verification:** Validate file extensions in URLs

## User Protection Measures

### Warning Systems
- **Danger alerts:** Clear warnings for potentially unsafe files
- **User confirmation:** Explicit consent required for risky operations
- **Education content:** Information about file safety and best practices
- **Escape mechanisms:** Easy cancellation of unsafe operations

### Safe Defaults
- **Conservative processing:** Default to safest processing method
- **Opt-in risk:** Users must explicitly choose to process dangerous files
- **Minimal functionality:** Only essential features enabled by default

## Vulnerability Response

### Security Monitoring
- **Dependency tracking:** Monitor security advisories for used libraries
- **Code review:** Regular security review of application code
- **Community oversight:** Open source enables community security review

### Response Process
1. **Identification:** Security issues identified through monitoring or reports
2. **Assessment:** Evaluate severity and impact of security vulnerabilities
3. **Mitigation:** Develop and test security fixes
4. **Deployment:** Release security updates promptly
5. **Communication:** Notify users of security updates when appropriate

## Threat Model

### Threats We Protect Against
- **Malicious files:** Detection and safe handling of dangerous file types
- **XSS attacks:** Content Security Policy prevents script injection
- **Data exfiltration:** No network connections prevent data theft
- **Memory attacks:** Automatic cleanup prevents memory-based attacks

### Threats Outside Our Scope
- **System-level malware:** Users must maintain system security
- **Network-level attacks:** Users responsible for network security
- **Browser vulnerabilities:** Rely on browser security updates
- **External website security:** Cannot control third-party website security

## Security Best Practices for Users

### File Handling
- **Verify sources:** Only process files from trusted sources
- **Use antivirus:** Maintain updated antivirus software
- **System updates:** Keep operating system and browser updated
- **Backup data:** Maintain backups of important files

### Safe Browsing
- **HTTPS sites:** Prefer secure websites for file downloads
- **Trusted domains:** Only access files from reputable websites
- **Browser security:** Enable browser security features
- **Privacy settings:** Configure browser privacy settings appropriately

## Security Testing

### Automated Testing
- **Dependency scanning:** Regular scanning for vulnerable dependencies
- **Static analysis:** Code analysis for security vulnerabilities
- **Penetration testing:** Regular security testing of application

### Manual Testing
- **Code review:** Manual review of security-critical code
- **Threat modeling:** Regular assessment of security threats
- **User testing:** Testing of security warnings and user flows

## Reporting Security Issues

### How to Report
- **GitHub Issues:** Report non-sensitive security issues publicly
- **Community Discussion:** Discuss security concerns in project forums
- **Documentation:** Review security documentation for common issues

### Response Timeline
- **Acknowledgment:** Security reports acknowledged within 48 hours
- **Assessment:** Security issues assessed within 7 days
- **Resolution:** Critical security issues resolved within 30 days
