# OmniPlay Privacy Enforcement Policy

## Absolute No-Data-Storage Guarantee

OmniPlay implements **ZERO data persistence** through multiple enforcement layers:

### 1. Server-Side Enforcement
- **No logging**: User files and data are never logged
- **No caching**: Cache-Control headers prevent any caching
- **No sessions**: No session storage or cookies
- **No database**: No database connections or storage
- **Memory-only**: All processing occurs in RAM and is immediately discarded

### 2. Client-Side Enforcement
- **Disabled localStorage**: localStorage.setItem() throws errors
- **Disabled sessionStorage**: sessionStorage is cleared and disabled
- **No cookies**: No cookie storage permitted
- **Memory cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of file data after processing
- **Object URL cleanup**: Immediate cleanup of blob URLs

### 3. Security Headers
